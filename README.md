## How to use autoKenpos
Chrome driver and google chrome must apply each other.  
If don't launch, check versions of them.

```bash
sudo cp driver/chrome-driver /usr/local/bin
```

You need to install python libraries.
```bash
sudo apt install python python-pip
sudo apt-get install xvfb
pip install pyvirtualdisplay selenium
```
Good luck!!!
